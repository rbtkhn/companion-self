# Workspace boundary — no grace-mar writes

This is the **companion-self (template)** workspace. The grace-mar repo, when present, is **read-only reference**.

- **Do not** write to, edit, or modify any file under the grace-mar folder from this workspace.
- **Do** read grace-mar when needed to generalize, compare paths, or extract content for the template.
- **Override:** Only if the user explicitly asks you to change something in grace-mar (e.g. "edit grace-mar's MERGING-FROM-COMPANION-SELF" or "update that file in grace-mar") may you write to grace-mar from this workspace.

Default: no grace-mar modifications. Explicit user request = override.
