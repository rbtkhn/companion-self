# Skill-work submodule

**Companion-Self template · Alpha reference and lesson-delivery pattern**

This submodule consolidates Alpha School reference material and the template’s **Record-driven lesson** pattern for use by WORK, the Record, and instances.

## Contents

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **[alpha-school-reference.md](alpha-school-reference.md)** | Alpha’s primary deliverable (comparison target); benchmarks; 2-hour screen-time target and detailed composition (schedule, apps, mastery thresholds); use in companion-self; **Record-driven prompts** (3–5 lessons via ChatGPT/Grok, transcript → skill-think). |
| **[insights-alpha-moonshots-233-for-business.md](insights-alpha-moonshots-233-for-business.md)** | Alpha/Moonshots #233 insights for business plan, white paper, and GTM (THINK/WRITE/WORK narrative). Optional for instances. |

## Why this submodule exists

- **Single place** for Alpha benchmarks, 2-hour target, and “how companion-self compares” so the template doesn’t scatter Alpha content across multiple docs.
- **Record-driven prompts** are documented here (§4.1 of alpha-school-reference): prompt from Record → any LLM → transcript → skill-think. The schema’s minimal prompt shape is in [schema-record-api.md](../schema-record-api.md#record-derived-lesson-prompt-minimal-shape).
