# Skill-work-human-teacher submodule

**Companion-Self template · Human teaching/learning objectives and skill-think**

This submodule consolidates **human teaching and learning objectives** for when an operator, parent, caregiver, or teacher augments the system. It is **designed to teach the human companion** (how to read and modulate skill-think, run the gate, suggest focus). The same framework can also be **instructed** for other contexts: **classes, seminars, different ages, and languages**; instances may add instructor briefs or localized variants.

## Contents

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **[human-teacher-objectives.md](human-teacher-objectives.md)** | Human teaching/learning objectives; **default academic objectives for new users** (edge, mastery, learning-how-to-learn, visible progress, identity, 2-hour design); how to **read** skill-think (edge, gate, session brief) and **shape** it (gate, focus, process prompts). Aligns with recursive self-learning when a human is in the loop. |

## Why this submodule exists

- **Single place** for “operator may augment” and human-teacher behavior: objectives, read skill-think, modulate skill-think. Designed to teach the human companion first; can be instructed for classes, seminars, different ages, and languages. The template assumes no human guide; this doc scopes what happens when one is present.
- **skill-think as interface:** The human teacher reads self-skill-think and edge to see what’s been learned and what’s next; they modulate by gating and suggesting focus, so THINK stays coherent and companion-sovereign.
