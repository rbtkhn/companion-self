# Alpha School Reference (Skill-Work Submodule)

**Companion-Self template · Source:** *Moonshots #233 — This $40M AI Company Is Using AI Tutors to Teach 2 Hours/Day* (Alpha Schools: McKenzie Price, Joe Lamont). This doc consolidates **benchmarks** and the **2-hour screen-time target** for use by WORK and the Record. Companion-Self does not replicate Alpha’s model; these are reference points for comparable metrics and design constraints.

---

## 1. Alpha’s primary deliverable (comparison target)

Alpha School’s **primary deliverable** — the target to compare companion-self education outcomes against — can be stated as:

| Dimension | Alpha’s deliverable | Verified sources |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Screen time** | **~2 hours per day** of AI-assisted educational screen time for full K–12 academic coverage. | Alpha’s “2-hour school day”; Moonshots #233; alpha.school, 2hourlearning.com. |
| **Outcome level** | **Top 1–2% nationally** (e.g. MAP Growth, SAT seniors ~1535 / whole high school ~1410; state test mastery “100” per level). | Moonshots #233 transcript; Alpha results pages; third-party coverage. |
| **Experience** | **>90% “love school”** (measured weekly); 40–60% “rather go to school than vacation.” | Transcript; Alpha positioning. |

**Use for companion-self:** Instances do not replicate Alpha’s delivery (no in-room guides, no $40K tuition, no proprietary curriculum engine). They **compare outcomes** against this deliverable: same **2-hour design constraint** (§3) and **equivalent or comparable outcome metrics** (§4) — e.g. evidence-linked mastery, retention, edge coverage, export use — so “Alpha-style” is concrete and measurable.

## 2. Alpha School benchmarks (from transcript)

### 2.1 Academic benchmarks

| Benchmark | What Alpha uses / claims | Source quote / note |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **SAT** | **Seniors:** average 1535 (vs national ~1024). **Whole high school:** average 1410. **Freshman goal:** minimum 1410; “some already over 1500 as freshmen.” Top 1–2% nationally. | “Our average SAT score for our seniors is 1535”; “1410 is the average for our entire high school”; “freshman’s goal this year is minimum 1410.” |
| **State standardized tests** | **Texas STAR** (state test) cited. Mastery-based: students “get hundreds on their standardized tests … for each level.” “Don’t move up until you master.” | “In our case the Texas STAR is the state standardized test”; “can you get 100 on the Texas STAR … 95% of alpha students say you can get 100 because they have [mastery].” |
| **Placement / onboarding** | “Assessments so we can figure out where they are” at entry. Used to set starting level (knowledge/interest). | “As part of their onboarding they do assessments so we can figure out where they are.” |
| **APs** | “Being able to crush your APs” as part of academic goals; reading, writing, math, science. | Referenced as outcome; no specific AP pass-rate given in transcript. |

### 2.2 Non-academic / experience benchmarks

| Benchmark | What Alpha uses / claims | Source quote / note |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Love of school** | **>90%** of kids “love school.” Measured **weekly** (survey). | “We actually measure it where over 90% of our kids love school. We measure every week we ask them.” |
| **School vs vacation** | “Would you rather go to school or go on vacation?” — **40–60%** say they’d rather go to school (depending on workshop/vacation). | “We actually upped it where we actually say, would you rather go to school or go on vacation? And 40 to 60% of our students say they’d rather go to school.” |
| **Belief in mastery** | **~95%** of Alpha students say “you can get 100” on state test (vs **<10%** of parents who believe that). | “If you ask alpha parents … fewer than 10% … yeah of course you can get 100 … if you ask the alpha students 95% say you can get 100.” |

### 2.3 Proof / research (mentioned in transcript)

| Item | What was said | Note |
|------|----------------|------|
| **RCT / pharmaceutical-grade trial** | Desire for “randomized control trial … pharmaceutical grade … so everybody can say this isn’t a hoax.” “5 million kids and there’s no randomized control trial.” | Framed as **needed** proof, not yet done. Companion-Self can define its own proof architecture (retention, evidence ratio, gate integrity) without requiring an RCT. |
| **Learning science** | 40 years of research; “Bloom’s two sigma”; “10,000 papers”; “kids can learn 2–5–10x faster” in right model. | Alpha positions its results as consistent with this body of work. |

---

## 3. Two-hour screen-time target

Companion-Self is calibrated so that **all screen-based learning is designed to occur within a 2-hour window per day**. This aligns with Alpha School’s model (full mandatory education in ~2 hours of screen time) and provides an **equivalent metric** for comparison and design.

### 3.1 Alpha’s 2-hour frame

Alpha School squeezes the full academic program into **~2 hours of screen time per day**: personalized AI-tutored lessons, mastery-based progress, at the zone of proximal development. The rest of the day is life skills, workshops, and non-screen activity. That 2-hour block is the **mandatory education** window.

**Estimated composition (from Moonshots #233):**

| Component | What it is (from transcript) | Approx. role in 2 hours |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **When** | "2-hour core learning block" after "Limitless Launch"; "by lunchtime they're finished with academics." | Single continuous block; **Limitless Launch is not screen time** (physical/growth mindset). |
| **Structure** | "Kids are on computers"; "breaks every 30 minutes … stretch and play." | ~**4 segments** of ~25–30 min net focus, with short breaks in between. |
| **Content** | "Full academic program"; "reading and writing and math and science"; "crush your APs"; K–12. | **All core subjects** in one block; personalized mix per kid. |
| **Delivery** | "One-to-one interaction on the computer"; "zone of proximal development"; "lessons aren't too hard … not so easy." | **AI-generated personalized lessons** (dynamic per kid), not lecture or open chat. |
| **No open chat** | "We don't have chat functionality enabled" in the morning; "chat steals that away … we want to fill kids with ideas." | **Structured lessons only**; no general-purpose chat during the 2 hours. |
| **Adults in room** | "Guides" — "not teaching academics"; "Did you check your resources? … Were you reading the explanation?"; motivation, high standards. | **Guides do not deliver curriculum**; they motivate and coach "learning how to learn," so screen time = AI + apps. |

#### 3.1.1 Detailed composition (research-verified)

The following details are drawn from Alpha’s public materials, support docs, and third-party coverage (alpha.school blog, support.alpha.school, timeback.com, timebacklearn.com, DeepLearning.AI, edu-live.com) for comparison and design reference.

**Schedule (typical campus):**

| Time | Activity | Screen time? |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 8:15–8:30 | Drop-off | No |
| 8:45–9:00 | Morning launch / Limitless Launch (motivational) | No |
| 9:00–11:30 | **2-Hour Learning block** (core academics) | **Yes** |
| 10:15–10:30 | Snack / outdoor recess (mid-block break) | No |
| 11:30–12:30 | Lunch / recess | No |
| 12:30–4:00 | Life-skills workshops (entrepreneurship, athletics, leadership, public speaking) | Mostly no |

Net **academic screen time** in the block is ~2–2.5 hours (2.5 hr gross minus ~15 min break). Alpha describes this as “two hours” of AI-tutored academics; by lunchtime academics are done.

**Time per activity within the block:**

- **25-minute Pomodoro sessions** per subject (Alpha blog FAQ): four such blocks fill the morning; short breaks between (e.g. stretch/play) every ~30 minutes.
- **30-minute subject blocks** (sample schedule PDF, campus docs): Math, Science, English, Social Studies in consecutive 30-min segments. Both descriptions align with ~4 focused segments of 25–30 min.
- Lessons are tuned so students answer correctly **~80–85% of the time** (zone of proximal development)—challenging but attainable.

**Platform and apps:**

- **TimeBack** — Proprietary platform that orchestrates the 2-hour block: diagnostics, personalized lessons, mastery tracking, progress UI. Delivers “2 hours daily” to “99th percentile” (MAP) positioning. (timeback.com, timebacklearn.com, Alpha blog.)
- **Custom apps (within TimeBack):** AlphaRead (reading comprehension), AlphaWrite (writing), Math Academy (math, concept-based mastery), TeachTower (daily challenges, mastery units), StudyReel (time and progress tracking), MasteryTrack / AlphaTest (assessments), Amplify (time tracking), Ephor (AI platform for lesson generation). (support.alpha.school “Working in Apps,” TimeBack/Alpha descriptions.)
- **Third-party / integrated:** IXL, Khan Academy, NewsELA, CommonLit, ReadTheory, Renaissance, eGUMPP, Knewton, Lalilo, Rocket Math, Zearn. (Alpha support docs.)
- **AlphaRead specifics:** Articles with 4 guiding questions + 4 quiz questions; **80% overall accuracy** required for mastery; score hexagon turns green when mastered. (support.alpha.school AlphaRead article.)
- **Mastery thresholds:** Advance only after **≥90% accuracy** (Bloom-style mastery); full grade level in **~20–30 hours** of focused study (often stated as “~10× faster” than traditional pacing).

**AI and personalization:**

- **Knowledge graph** — What the student has mastered vs. missing; used to generate lessons at the right level.
- **Interest graph** — Themes, hobbies, cultural references; used to tailor examples (e.g. Taylor Swift, Hamilton) for engagement.
- **Generative AI** — Builds lessons and questions in real time; “curriculum of one.” Not open chat; AI acts as tutor/coach, not answer machine. Chat is disabled during the academic block to avoid “cheatbots.”
- **Vision / behavior monitoring (optional):** Computer vision can monitor the screen to flag off-task behavior (scrolling without reading, skipping explanations, guessing). “Waste meter” shows minutes “wasted”; used to coach focus. (DeepLearning.AI “Inside Alpha School,” Alpha blog.) Not all implementations may use this.

**Summary for companion-self:** The 2 hours consist of **structured, app-based lessons** (TimeBack + custom + selected third-party), **25–30 min subject blocks**, **90% mastery to advance**, **80–85% in-lesson success rate**, **no open chat**, and **optional vision-based focus coaching**. Companion-Self instances can compare by aligning: block length (~2 hr), segment length (e.g. 25–30 min), mastery bar, and type of activity (curriculum/tutor-driven, not chat).

### 3.2 Companion-Self calibration

- **Design constraint:** Structure the product and ritual so that curriculum, tutor use, Record capture, and any screen-based learning (THINK, WRITE, and screen-linked WORK) are **designed to fit within 2 hours per day**. The Record and pipeline support this.
- **Equivalent metric:** When comparing companion-self (or an instance) to Alpha, **2 hours of screen time per day** is the common denominator. Outcomes (mastery, evidence, motivation) can be compared **per 2-hour block** so that “2 hours = full academic coverage” is the shared frame.
- **Time back:** Anything that reduces required screen time below 2 hours preserves “time back” for the companion; 2 hours is the **ceiling** for mandatory screen-based learning, not a minimum to fill.

### 3.3 What counts as screen time (for the metric)

- Time in curriculum/tutor apps (Khan, IXL, AI tutor, etc.) that feed the Record.
- Time in the companion-self student interface (dashboard, “we did X,” review queue, export).
- Time in Voice/chat that is part of the learning or capture flow.
- Any other screen-based activity that is explicitly part of the **learning block** (THINK/WRITE/screen WORK).

Excluded: non-learning screen use (e.g. entertainment), and optional off-screen activity (life skills, WORK that isn’t on screen). Instances may define precise boundaries.

### 3.4 Use in product

- **Student app:** Surface or assume a **daily 2-hour learning block** (e.g. “Designed for up to 2 hours of screen-based learning per day.”).
- **Export / curriculum profile:** Optional field: `screen_time_target_minutes: 120` so curriculum/tutor integrations can align to the same window.
- **Recursive self-learning:** Objectives (edge, mastery, motivation) are calibrated so that progress is achievable **within** the 2-hour block when combined with external curriculum/tutor.

## 4. Use in companion-self (without a human guide)

- **Without a human guide:** Companion-Self must achieve its objectives and demonstrate value using **system- and Record-based metrics** (e.g. evidence growth, retention, edge coverage, export use), not in-room guides. Alpha’s benchmarks are **reference points** for “what good looks like,” not a requirement to replicate SAT or Texas STAR.
- **Equivalent or comparable metrics** (template/instance may choose):
  - **Mastery / level:** Evidence-linked progress; “100” or “mastery” per topic/level in the Record; export for curriculum/tutor that can target same standards.
  - **Engagement / motivation:** Retention (e.g. week-4, month-3); “love of learning” or “would rather do learning block than X” style survey; evidence count and “time back” as proxies.
  - **Placement / edge:** Onboarding or seed-phase “where they are”; edge derived from Record (IX-A, IX-B, self-skill-*) for personalized next steps.

### 4.1 Record-driven prompts: personalized lessons without Alpha’s stack

Companion-self can replace much of Alpha’s proprietary stack (TimeBack, custom apps, in-room setup) with **custom-generated prompts** that users (or the companion/operator) paste into **any LLM** to trigger a personalized lesson. The prompt is built from the Record only: knowledge (IX-A), curiosity (IX-B), personality (IX-C), edge (what’s next per THINK/WRITE/WORK), and self-skill-* so the lesson fits level and interests. The LLM is the tutor; companion-self supplies the context and the “curriculum of one” via the prompt.

- **Knowledge boundary:** Prompt content is drawn from the Record (companion-provided and approved). No LLM inference is written back into the Record; the lesson stays in the chat/session. Evidence of what was done can be captured via “we did X” and merged through the gate as usual.
- **Cost and access:** Any LLM (local, API, free tier) can deliver the lesson. No proprietary platform or tuition required; the template or instance provides the prompt pattern and, optionally, a small generator that fills it from the Record/export.
- **Same 2-hour frame:** Lessons triggered by these prompts still fit the 2-hour design constraint (§3); the user chooses when and where to run the LLM session. Outcomes remain comparable via evidence-linked mastery and edge (§4 metrics).

A **typical learner experience** is **3 to 5 personalized lessons** per day (or per 2-hour block), each triggered by a Record-derived prompt. Lessons are often delivered through **ChatGPT or Grok** (or any LLM the user chooses); the prompt ensures the lesson is tailored to the Record and edge. The **transcript of the LLM lesson conversation** can then flow into **skill-think** (self-skill-think) for processing: staged as a candidate or ingested for review, then merged into the Record (e.g. THINK evidence, updated edge, or dimension lines) via the usual pipeline and human-approval gate.

For many people, this **LLM lesson method** (prompt → any LLM → transcript → skill-think) can be **easier and more useful** than a dedicated bot (e.g. Telegram): no app install or account beyond an LLM they already use, one place for lessons and chat, and the same Record-driven pipeline. Instances can offer both; the template does not prescribe one delivery channel.

Instances may implement a **prompt generator** (e.g. in the student app or export pipeline) that takes the current Record and edge and outputs a ready-to-paste prompt (e.g. “You are tutoring a learner. Here is what they know, what they’re curious about, and what to teach next: …”). Template docs can define a minimal prompt shape and required Record fields so instances and operators can replicate the pattern.
