# Recursive Self-Learning Objectives

**Companion-Self template · Inspired by learning science and AI-powered education**

This doc captures **objectives** for how a companion self (Record + pipeline + Voice) can improve itself over time—*recursive self-learning*. The framing is inspired by learning-science principles and by models such as **Alpha Schools** (AI tutors, mastery-based learning, 2-hour academic block, life skills, closed-loop improvement), as discussed in *Moonshots #233 — This $40M AI Company Is Using AI Tutors to Teach 2 Hours/Day* (Alpha leadership: McKenzie Price, Joe Lamont). The companion self is not a school; these objectives translate those ideas into Record-centric, evidence-grounded, companion-sovereign terms.

**No human guide assumed.** These objectives must be achievable **without assuming the help of a human guide**. Where Alpha uses in-room “guides” for motivation and “learning how to learn,” companion-self embeds equivalent support in the **system**: Voice (in-character coaching), pipeline and session prompts (“Did you read the explanation?”), edge-driven suggestions, and visible progress (evidence count, “X hours away”). An operator may augment but is not required.

## 1. Recursive learning (closed loop)

**Objective:** The Record improves itself over time. Each pipeline cycle (capture → stage → approve → merge) refines the Record; the updated Record shapes the next cycle (e.g. analyst dedup, Voice responses, and—where implemented—proposed activities at the edge).

**Inspiration:** Alpha’s closed-loop data cycle: generate lessons → kids do lessons → measure learning → adapt. “Reinforcement learning for kids.” Companion-Self inverts who is improved: the *Record* (the documented self) is what gets refined; the companion remains sovereign and gates every merge.

## 2. Activity at the edge (zone of proximal development)

**Objective:** Propose and capture activity at the **container edge**—the boundary of current capability—so the companion is challenged but not overwhelmed. Too easy → no growth; too hard → disengagement. The Record (e.g. self-skill-read, self-skill-write, self-skill-work, IX-A/IX-B) defines the edge; activities and evidence at the edge extend it.

**Inspiration:** “80–85% accuracy… not too easy, not too hard.” “Zone of proximal development.” “Every game designer will tell you if you drop below 66, the kids disengage.” Companion-Self: the edge is derived from SELF + self-skill-read/write/build + EVIDENCE; the pipeline (and any curriculum or tutor integration) can use it to suggest what to do next, without the system merging on its own.

## 3. Mastery-based, not time-based

**Objective:** Progress by **mastery and evidence**, not by seat time or calendar. Nothing enters the Record without being written and approved; capability claims trace to artifacts. The companion (and operator, when relevant) sees what is actually demonstrated, not a grade that hides years of gap.

**Inspiration:** “Time-based system vs mastery-based system.” “You don’t move up until you master… the system’s going to give you the personalized lesson so you can.” “A student on their transcript could be one year ahead or three years behind.” Companion-Self: evidence linkage and the gate enforce mastery-based growth; no “moving on” without approved merge.

## 4. Knowledge and interest as structure

**Objective:** Use the Record’s **knowledge** (e.g. IX-A) and **curiosity/interests** (e.g. IX-B) to personalize what gets proposed, looked up, or reflected back. The Record is the identity layer: what they know, what they care about, how they speak. No LLM inference into the Record; use only what is documented.

**Inspiration:** “Knowledge graph… what do they know and not know? Interest graph… Taylor Swift, Genghis Khan.” “Generate a personal lesson… at their zone.” Companion-Self: IX-A, IX-B, SELF drive personalization; the knowledge boundary keeps the Record from being filled by model training data.

---

## 5. Motivation and ownership

**Objective:** Design so the companion (and operator) experience **ownership** and **visible progress**. The Record is theirs; they gate what enters. Where applicable, make progress legible (e.g. “you’re X hours away,” evidence count, edge clarity) so effort maps to growth. “Time back” and structure of the day can motivate: e.g. focused capture blocks, then free space for other things.

**Inspiration:** “Give the kids their time back.” “You’re 17 hours away, you’re 5 hours away.” “Moves everything from I’m not smart enough to I’m five hours away from mastering it.” Companion-Self: the companion is the gate; the pipeline makes progress visible through the Record and staging, not through external grades. **Time calibration:** All screen-based learning is designed to fit within **2 hours per day** (equivalent metric to Alpha); see [TWO-HOUR-SCREENTIME-TARGET](TWO-HOUR-SCREENTIME-TARGET.md).

## 6. Learning how to learn

**Objective:** Support **learning-how-to-learn** (process, resources, feedback) as much as content. The **pipeline and Voice** (not a human in the room) provide guide-like coaching: “Did you check your resources? Read the explanation?” Evidence and structure in the Record reflect both *what* was learned and *how* it was learned (e.g. READ/WRITE/WORK dimensions, artifact type).

**Inspiration:** Guides “helping kids develop that skill of learning how to learn… connect you with experts.” “Learning science… chemistry of the mind… how many reps to store long-term memory.” Companion-Self: the same support is **built into the system**—Voice, pipeline prompts, and session copy—so the companion can improve without a human guide. The human remains the primary learner; the system is the coach.

## 7. Character and identity beyond productivity

**Objective:** The Record encodes **who the companion is**—values, character, relationships, narrative—not only what they produce or score. Recursive self-learning includes growth in identity (e.g. IX-C, narrative, values) as well as knowledge and skills.

**Inspiration:** “Fifth pillar is character and culture and classmates.” “Good human beings.” “Identity beyond productivity” (companion-self invariant). Companion-Self: SELF and post-seed growth (IX-A, IX-B, IX-C) already frame this; the objectives reinforce that recursion improves the whole Record, not only academic or skill slices.

---

## 8. Iteration and measurement

**Objective:** Treat the pipeline and Record as **iterative**: measure what works (e.g. which signals get merged, how the Voice performs, how activities at the edge play out), and refine process and schema over time. Instance-level validation (e.g. governance checker, validate-integrity) and operator feedback are part of the loop.

**Inspiration:** “Learning science team comes up with an idea… put it in… measure… adapt.” “We update every six weeks.” Companion-Self: template and instances both iterate; the template evolves protocol and seed definition; instances evolve Record and pipeline; neither overwrites the other’s sovereign domain.

## Summary

| Objective | Companion-Self translation |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Closed loop | Record improves each cycle; Record shapes next cycle (recursive learning). |
| Activity at edge | Propose/capture at container edge; self-skill-* + IX drive edge. |
| Mastery-based | Evidence-linked; gate; no merge without approval. |
| Knowledge + interest | IX-A, IX-B, SELF as identity layer; knowledge boundary. |
| Motivation & ownership | Companion as gate; progress visible; “time back” via structure. |
| Learning how to learn | Process and evidence in Record; pipeline supports meta-learning. |
| Character & identity | SELF, IX-C; identity beyond productivity. |
| Iteration & measurement | Pipeline and template iterate; validate; refine. |

Companion-Self does not implement a school or curriculum; these objectives use learning science and Alpha’s model as **inspiration** for recursive self-learning in a companion-owned, evidence-grounded Record.
