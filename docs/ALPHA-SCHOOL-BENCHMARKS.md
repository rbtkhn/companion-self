# Alpha School Benchmarks (from Moonshots #233)

**Companion-Self template · Reference**

Alpha School’s stated outcomes and measurement practices, as described in *Moonshots #233 — This $40M AI Company Is Using AI Tutors to Teach 2 Hours/Day* (McKenzie Price, Joe Lamont). Companion-Self does not replicate Alpha’s model; this doc captures **what benchmarks Alpha uses** so instances can define equivalent or comparable metrics without assuming a human guide.

## 1. Academic benchmarks (from transcript)

| Benchmark | What Alpha uses / claims | Source quote / note |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **SAT** | **Seniors:** average 1535 (vs national ~1024). **Whole high school:** average 1410. **Freshman goal:** minimum 1410; “some already over 1500 as freshmen.” Top 1–2% nationally. | “Our average SAT score for our seniors is 1535”; “1410 is the average for our entire high school”; “freshman’s goal this year is minimum 1410.” |
| **State standardized tests** | **Texas STAR** (state test) cited. Mastery-based: students “get hundreds on their standardized tests … for each level.” “Don’t move up until you master.” | “In our case the Texas STAR is the state standardized test”; “can you get 100 on the Texas STAR … 95% of alpha students say you can get 100 because they have [mastery].” |
| **Placement / onboarding** | “Assessments so we can figure out where they are” at entry. Used to set starting level (knowledge/interest). | “As part of their onboarding they do assessments so we can figure out where they are.” |
| **APs** | “Being able to crush your APs” as part of academic goals; reading, writing, math, science. | Referenced as outcome; no specific AP pass-rate given in transcript. |

## 2. Non-academic / experience benchmarks

| Benchmark | What Alpha uses / claims | Source quote / note |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Love of school** | **>90%** of kids “love school.” Measured **weekly** (survey). | “We actually measure it where over 90% of our kids love school. We measure every week we ask them.” |
| **School vs vacation** | “Would you rather go to school or go on vacation?” — **40–60%** say they’d rather go to school (depending on workshop/vacation). | “We actually upped it where we actually say, would you rather go to school or go on vacation? And 40 to 60% of our students say they’d rather go to school.” |
| **Belief in mastery** | **~95%** of Alpha students say “you can get 100” on state test (vs **<10%** of parents who believe that). | “If you ask alpha parents … fewer than 10% … yeah of course you can get 100 … if you ask the alpha students 95% say you can get 100.” |

## 3. Proof / research (mentioned in transcript)

| Item | What was said | Note |
|------|----------------|------|
| **RCT / pharmaceutical-grade trial** | Desire for “randomized control trial … pharmaceutical grade … so everybody can say this isn’t a hoax.” “5 million kids and there’s no randomized control trial.” | Framed as **needed** proof, not yet done. Companion-Self can define its own proof architecture (retention, evidence ratio, gate integrity) without requiring an RCT. |
| **Learning science** | 40 years of research; “Bloom’s two sigma”; “10,000 papers”; “kids can learn 2–5–10x faster” in right model. | Alpha positions its results as consistent with this body of work. |

## 4. Use in companion-self

- **Without a human guide:** Companion-Self must achieve its objectives and demonstrate value using **system- and Record-based metrics** (e.g. evidence growth, retention, edge coverage, export use), not in-room guides. Alpha’s benchmarks are **reference points** for “what good looks like,” not a requirement to replicate SAT or Texas STAR.
- **Equivalent or comparable metrics** (template/instance may choose):
  - **Mastery / level:** Evidence-linked progress; “100” or “mastery” per topic/level in the Record; export for curriculum/tutor that can target same standards.
  - **Engagement / motivation:** Retention (e.g. week-4, month-3); “love of learning” or “would rather do learning block than X” style survey; evidence count and “time back” as proxies.
  - **Placement / edge:** Onboarding or seed-phase “where they are”; edge derived from Record (IX-A, IX-B, SKILLS) for personalized next steps.
- **Roadmap:** See [ROADMAP-3Y-90-10](ROADMAP-3Y-90-10.md) “Outcome metrics” and “Proof architecture”—no need to match Alpha’s SAT; do match “mastery-based, evidence-rich, portable identity.”
