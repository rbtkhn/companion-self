# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this template or its documentation, please report it:

- **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self/security/advisories/new) or a regular issue describing the concern (without sensitive details).
- **Alternative:** Contact the repository maintainer directly if you prefer not to disclose publicly.

We will acknowledge and respond as quickly as we can. We do not require confidential disclosure for this template repo; if you need a formal process, say so in your report.

This template does not store credentials or user data; instances that fork it are responsible for their own security practices.
