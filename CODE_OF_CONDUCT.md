# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the community and the companion-self template.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the repository maintainer. We reserve the right to remove or edit content that does not align with this code of conduct.

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0.
