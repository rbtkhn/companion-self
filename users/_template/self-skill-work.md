# self-skill-work (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy to `users/<new_id>/self-skill-work.md` in an instance. Schema tag: **WORK**. Making and doing; populated from activity.

Evidence-linked; planning, execution, collaboration, originality per instance schema.

## Channels / interfaces (overlap with WRITE)

Same channels that can carry WRITE (Voice, expression) can also be **work interfaces**: the companion (including an autonomous agent or non-human economic actor, e.g. a business) may *do* work through them—transact, respond, publish, operate. Instance fills in which are in use; no secrets here—reference only.

- • **Telegram bot** — (e.g. bot handle; for messaging, automation, or economic activity)
- • **WeChat bot / official channel** — (e.g. channel; for outreach, support, or commerce)
- • **HTML page** — (e.g. site or app URL; for presence, offers, or self-service)
- • **Email account** — (e.g. address; for correspondence, contracts, or notifications)
- • **X.com API** — (e.g. account or app; for posting, listening, or API-driven work)

(Add or remove per instance. Evidence of WORK may link to these interfaces. Overlap with self-skill-write is intentional: one identity can both *express* (WRITE) and *act* (WORK) through the same channels.)

## Planning / execution

(Placeholder: projects, deliverables, financial, collaboration, originality — populated from activity.)
