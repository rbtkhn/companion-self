# EVIDENCE — Activity and Artifact Log (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. Evidence links every SELF/self-skill-* claim to artifacts or approved sources.

Governed by the instance's EVIDENCE template. Tiers: e.g. OBSERVED, ATTESTED, VERIFIED, CERTIFIED. Reading list, writing log, creation log, activity log per instance schema.

## Activity Log

---

## Writing / Creation Log

(Placeholder: WRITE/WORK artifacts — references only; files in artifacts/.)

*Do not use this file as a live Record. Copy to `users/<new_id>/EVIDENCE.md` in an instance and replace placeholders with real data.*
