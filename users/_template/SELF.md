# SELF — Identity Record (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. Fill with seed-phase output and post-seed pipeline merges.

Governed by the instance's SELF template / CONCEPT. Schema: identity, personality, linguistic style, narrative, preferences, values, reasoning patterns, interests; post-seed growth in IX-A (knowledge), IX-B (curiosity), IX-C (personality).

---

## I. Identity

(Placeholder: name, identifiers, locale — instance-specific.)

---

## II–VIII. Baseline (Seed)

(Placeholder: personality, narrative, preferences, values, etc. — populated from seed phase.)

---

## IX. Post-Seed Growth

### IX-A. Knowledge

(Facts entering awareness through observation; evidence-linked.)

### IX-B. Curiosity

(Topics that catch attention; engagement signals.)

### IX-C. Personality (Observed)

(Behavioral patterns, speech traits, values — observed and documented.)

*Do not use this file as a live Record. Copy to `users/<new_id>/SELF.md` in an instance and replace placeholders with real data.*
