# self-personality — Voice, Preferences, Values (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. self-personality (IX-C) holds how they see themselves and express: voice, preferences, values, narrative, behavioral patterns. Pipeline suggests merges from READ activity; the companion gates what enters.

Governed by the instance. Can overlap with baseline personality in self.md; this file holds **observed and documented** growth after seed.
