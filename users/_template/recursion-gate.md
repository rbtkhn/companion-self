# recursion-gate — At the Gate (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. The pipeline stages candidates **at the gate**; only the companion (or delegated human) may merge approved items into self, self-evidence, and the dimension files.

Governed by Identity Fork Protocol: agent may stage, may not merge. The gate is where the **recursive** loop turns—proposed changes wait here until the companion approves; then they enter the Record and the system improves. Hence *recursion-gate*.

## Candidates

(Placeholder: each candidate has mind_category, signal_type, summary, profile_target, suggested_entry — per instance schema. Companion approves, rejects, or edits; then merge runs.)

---

*Do not use this file as a live staging area in the template. Copy to `users/<new_id>/recursion-gate.md` in an instance (or keep an equivalent name such as recursion-gate.json for the machine-readable queue).*
