# self-knowledge — What They've Learned (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. self-knowledge (IX-A) holds what the companion has learned and knows: topics, facts, understanding. Pipeline suggests merges from READ activity; the companion gates what enters.

Governed by the instance. Evidence-linked: every entry traces to an artifact or approved source.
