# self-memory — Ephemeral Session Context (Template)

**Template only. Not part of the Record.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. self-memory holds tone, recent topics, calibrations for continuity between sessions. Optional. Rotate weekly (or when large); optional: note **Last rotated:** date in the header. When self-memory conflicts with SELF, SELF wins.

---

## Tone

(Placeholder: e.g. playful, calm, focused.)

---

## Recent Topics

(Placeholder: topics of recent conversation.)

---

## Calibrations

(Placeholder: e.g. "shorter answers today", "more questions than usual".)

---

## Resistance Notes

(Placeholder: topics to avoid or handle gently — e.g. resistance on a topic; use to avoid retriggering next session.)

*Do not use this file as a live self-memory in the template. Copy to `users/<new_id>/self-memory.md` in an instance if the instance uses ephemeral session context.*
