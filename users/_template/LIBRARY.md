# LIBRARY — Curated Lookup Sources (Template, Optional)

**Template only. Optional.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory if the instance supports a bounded lookup extension. LIBRARY is a **query-first** list of curated sources (books, reference works, videos) the companion or operator may use to answer questions—without auto-merging into the Record.

Governanced by the instance. Use: lookup from these sources when answering; do not infer into SELF or EVIDENCE unless the companion approves and merges via the normal pipeline.

## Books / Reference

(Placeholder: title, scope, how it’s used.)

## Videos / Media

(Placeholder: title or series, scope, how it’s used.)

*Optional. Do not use as a live record. Copy to `users/<new_id>/LIBRARY.md` in an instance only if the instance uses a bounded lookup extension.*
