# self-skill-read (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy to `users/<new_id>/self-skill-read.md` in an instance. Schema tag: **READ**. Intake and comprehension; populated from activity.

Evidence-linked; edge (what to read/watch next) derived from this file + self-evidence.

**Skill-read significantly draws on self-library.** The curated books, reference works, and videos in **self-library.md** are a primary input for what to read and watch; edge and “what’s next” should be informed by the library. READ activity and evidence can link to library sources. When the instance uses self-library, treat it as the main curated intake layer for READ.

## Key sources (primary)

- • **self-library** — Curated books, reference works, and videos. READ **significantly draws on** self-library for what to read and watch; edge (“what’s next”) should be informed by it. Link READ evidence to library entries when content comes from there. See `self-library.md`.
- • **X.com API** — Primary important source for **real-time and recent news**. Instance may use for trending topics, breaking news, or topic-specific feeds; evidence of READ can link to posts or threads consumed. (No tokens or secrets here—reference only.)

(Add other primary READ sources per instance: e.g. curriculum, RSS, video.)
