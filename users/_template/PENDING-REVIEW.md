# PENDING-REVIEW — Staging Area (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. Pipeline stages candidates here; only the companion (or delegated human) may merge approved items into SELF, EVIDENCE, etc.

Governed by Identity Fork Protocol: agent may stage, may not merge.

---

## Candidates

(Placeholder: each candidate has mind_category, signal_type, summary, profile_target, suggested_entry — per instance schema. Companion approves, rejects, or edits; then merge runs.)

---

*Do not use this file as a live staging area in the template. Copy to `users/<new_id>/PENDING-REVIEW.md` in an instance.*
