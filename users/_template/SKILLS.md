# SKILLS — Capability Record (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. Skills grow through activity (READ, WRITE, BUILD) after seed.

Governed by the instance's SKILLS template. Modules: READ (intake, comprehension), WRITE (production, expression), BUILD (making, planning, execution, creation). Evidence-linked; levels/dimensions per instance schema.

---

## WRITE

(Placeholder: vocabulary, complexity, style, expression, logic — populated from activity.)

---

## READ

(Placeholder: comprehension, inference, vocabulary, interests — populated from activity.)

---

## BUILD

(Placeholder: planning, execution, financial, collaboration, originality, etc. — populated from activity.)

---

*Do not use this file as a live Record. Copy to `users/<new_id>/SKILLS.md` in an instance and replace placeholders with real data.*
