# SELF — Identity Record (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. Fill with seed-phase output and post-seed pipeline merges. Optional: add Version, Status, or Created date in the header.

Governed by the instance's SELF template / CONCEPT. Schema: identity, personality, linguistic style, narrative, preferences, values, reasoning patterns, interests. **Post-seed growth (IX-A, IX-B, IX-C) lives in the three dimension files** — see below; do not duplicate that content here.

---

## I. Identity

(Placeholder: name, identifiers, locale — instance-specific.)

---

## II. Preferences

(Placeholder: favorites, activities, etc. — populated from seed phase.)

---

## III. Linguistic style

(Placeholder: vocabulary, reading level, sentence patterns, tone — populated from seed and evidence.)

---

## IV. Personality

(Placeholder: self-concept, traits, emotional patterns — populated from seed phase.)

---

## V. Interests

(Placeholder: current interests, emerging — populated from seed and evidence.)

---

## VI. Values

(Placeholder: core values — populated from seed phase.) Life mission (optional) lives here or in § VALUES; skill-work goals align with it. See `self-skill-work.md` § Life mission ref.

---

## VII. Reasoning patterns

(Placeholder: approach to new tasks, approach to difficulty — populated from seed phase.)

---

## VIII. Narrative

(Placeholder: family, places, significant events, relationships — populated from seed phase.)

---

## IX. Post-Seed Growth (Source of Truth Elsewhere)

Post-seed growth is stored in the three dimension files. Merge and Voice read from them for IX-A, IX-B, IX-C.

- **IX-A (knowledge)** → `self-knowledge.md`
- **IX-B (curiosity)** → `self-curiosity.md`
- **IX-C (personality)** → `self-personality.md`

Optionally, keep a one-line summary here (e.g. "3 topics, 5 interests, 2 observed traits") for at-a-glance; the canonical content is in the three files.

---

*Do not use this file as a live Record. Copy to `users/<new_id>/self.md` in an instance and replace placeholders with real data.*
