# self-curiosity — What They're Curious About (Template)

**Template only. No real data.** Copy this structure when creating a new user directory in an instance repo. self-curiosity (IX-B) holds what they are curious about: interests, questions, engagement signals. Pipeline suggests merges from READ activity; the companion gates what enters.

Governed by the instance. Evidence-linked where applicable.
